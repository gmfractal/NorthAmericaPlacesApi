# NorthAmericaPlacesApi

NorthAmericanPlaces API serves up North American country / province / state names plus abbreviations. GET end points have been set up to allow for searching by the full place name or by an abbreviation. 

The data for all of the place names come from a JSON file that is loaded and stored in a memory cache for better performance. The memory cache uses .NET's built-in IMemoryCache.

View the Swagger page of the running project (http://localhost:8000/swagger/index.html) for more information about the endpoints:
